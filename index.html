                The Andamans and Lakshadweep offer a quality of scuba diving unmatched in the world, and both now figure prominently in the itinerary of a fair number of domestic as well as foreign tourists. The biodiversity of these groups of islands, alongside their relatively warm waters, make scuba diving in India a very attractive adventure option.
